# Data Overview

**Note:** This repository contains only sample data for demonstration. 
The full training process will utilize the following datasets:

## 1. Targeted Datasets
- **DollarStreet (India Subset):** ~3,000 images of household items (Source: Gapminder).
- **Food-101 (Indian Extension):** ~2,000 images of 20 distinct Indian dishes (Source: Kaggle).

## 2. Indi-Bench Structure
We are curating a custom evaluation set (**Indi-Bench**) focusing on "Hard Negatives."
See `metadata.json` for the annotation schema.

## 3. How to Download Full Data (Planned)
Upon acceptance, we will provide a script `download_data.sh` to fetch and format the full datasets automatically.
